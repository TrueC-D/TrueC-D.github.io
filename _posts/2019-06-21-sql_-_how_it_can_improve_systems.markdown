Sql creates a space where data can be stored.  Without this database, your information will disappear after you reload a webpage as the data would not be saved.  This means a database like Sql is imperitive to creating a fully functioning website.  

Something I wonder when considereing this though is how exactly are things stored in the database.  Through the process of learning code, the way things work are less elusive, but how is that bits of code are stored within hardware in the frist place.  How is it that we can build firmware that can continuously update this hardware without actually phyically configuring and reconfiguring the hardware.

All these questions are things to learn in a future educational journey.

I am truly excited for what the next courses will teach me.  

I anticipate learning systems that will enable me to create a very versatile program.
