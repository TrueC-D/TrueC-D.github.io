Recently flatiron has been updating their student base.  

I was trying to find the platform to write my new blog post for the week, but it disappeared!!

Normally, the blog link is withing a navbar link at the top of the screen but it wasn't there anymore.  I had remembered that there were some git commits from a source I didn't recognize in my github, but I didn't find the URL there.

I searched "flatiron blog" but... that didn't direct my to the platform where I write my own blog.

I finally found the link by searching "learn.co blog".

I was lucky that I was able to find the link this way, but I can't rely on key word searches helping  the future.  I will be moving everything to a new blog site soon!
